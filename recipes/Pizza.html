    <h1><strong>Pizza recipe</strong></h1>
    <img src="/home/hudson/The-odin-project/odin-Recipies/images/pizza.jpg"><br>
    <h2>Ingredients<br></h2>
    <h3>For the base<br></h3>
    <p>300g strong bread flour<br>
        1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)<br>
        1 tsp salt<br>
        1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</p>
    <h2>For the tomato sauce</h2>
    <p>100ml passata<br>
        handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried<br>
        1 garlic clove, crushed</p>
    <h2>To finish</h2>
    <p>handful of basil leaves (optional)
    </p>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <h3>STEP 1</h3>
    <p>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</p>
    <h3>STEP 2</h3>
    <p>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</p>
    <h3>STEP 3</h3>
    <p>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</p>
    <h3>STEP 4</h3>
    <p>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</p>
